developed this program in C++ using the compiler located in /usr/bin/g++.

As a note to grader. The output times are matched all the way down the output.
However, the average wait time is off by a few seconds and the average turnaround
time is off by a few seconds. I am not sure what this is caused by as i have tired 
casting to float and double as well as changing the values in my PCB to double/float. Would love some input as to why this would be off by a couple of seconds.
